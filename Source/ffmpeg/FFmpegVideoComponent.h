/**
    FFmpegVideoComponent.h
 
    Author:  Clemens Bergthaller
 
    Video Component that allows basic video playback using FFmpeg

    This component is an alternative video component to the juce video component (which uses operating
    system functions for video playback and therefore has problems with some codecs, in my case h.264).
    This component tries to mimic the behaviour of the juce counterpart to some extend, but of course there
    are limits, i.e. it can read file streams only.
 
    It uses an FFmpegVideoReader and it's callbacks to play sound and display video images.
    
    This component was developed to display videos in h.264 format specifically, so it was ONLY tested with
    files using this format. Keep this in mind when using this! It still might work on some other videos. And I
    might change this in the future.
 
    To develop this video component and it it's substitues, I used my limited knowledge about FFmpeg and
    juce to mess with the ideas of Daniel Walz who developed:
    https://github.com/filmstro/filmstro_ffmpeg.
 
    Daniel Walz also developed a far more advanced video engine to also encode video data:
    https://github.com/ffAudio/foleys_video_engine
